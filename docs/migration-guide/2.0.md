# 2.0 Migration Guide

In this document we'll help you migrate your orchestrator application from orchestrator-core 1.3 to 2.0.

## About 2.0

In this release we migrate the orchestrator-core from Pydantic v1 to Pydantic v2.
This major change took a lot of effort ([PR](https://github.com/workfloworchestrator/orchestrator-core/pull/408)) as
Pydantic v2 is quite different.

There were quite a few breaking changes that we had to deal with.
We have adapted orchestrator-core to mitigate the impact of these breaking changes.
Your orchestrator application may need to be changed as well, we will guide you in this process.
Several changes have been automated through a migration script - more about this later.

## Steps

Make sure you have upgraded to the latest orchestrator-core 1.3.x release before starting.

* Create a new branch in your own orchestrator
* Create and activate a virtualenv with python 3.11 (recommend), 3.10 or 3.9 and install your dependencies
* Run `pip install -U orchestrator-core~=2.0.0` to get the latest 2.0 core version and upgrade all other dependencies
    * Add this to your pinned dependencies
* Run `pip install bump-pydantic` to install a migration tool made by the Pydantic maintainers
    * No need to add this to your dependencies
* Run `bump-pydantic .`
    * It is a bit fragile and not very fast on large codebases. You can run it against specific subdirectories to work
      around problematic files or slow performance
    * The tool will leave `# TODO[pydantic]` comments on pydantic 1.x code that it cannot automatically rewrite to
      pydantic 2.x
* Run `python -m orchestrator.devtools.scripts.migrate_20 <dir>` and point `<dir>` to your orchestrator code and tests
    * This migration script will perform a number of rewrites on your code for orchestrator-core 2.0

Then continue with the following sections.

### Pydantic v2 Changes

First and foremost, the full Pydantic v2 migration guide is located here https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.5/migration.

We recommend to read through it quickly before continuing with this guide.

Next we'll give you some pointers of what to change based on our experience of migrating the SURF orchestrator.

#### Change renamed BaseModel functions

Replace these deprecated function calls on any Pydantic Models (i.e. Subscriptions, ProductBlocks).

| Pydantic V1            | Pydantic V2            |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| __fields__             | model_fields           |
| __validators__         | __pydantic_validator__ |
| construct()            | model_construct()      |
| copy()                 | model_copy()           |
| dict()                 | model_dump()           |
| json_schema()          | model_json_schema()    |
| json()                 | model_dump_json()      |
| parse_obj()            | model_validate()       |
| update_forward_refs()  | model_rebuild()        |

#### Replace constrained types to `Annotated[]`

Most constrained types have been removed from Pydantic v2. We will show constrained int as an example.

The symbols in the after example can be imported with:
```python
from typing import Annotated
from annotated_types import Ge, Le, Len, MinLen, MaxLen, doc
```

**conint**

Before:

```python
ipv4_prefixlen: conint(ge=30, le=31)
```

After:
```python
ipv4_prefixlen: Annotated[int, Ge(30), Le(31)]
```


**ConstrainedInt**

Before:
```python
class NumberOfPeerings(ConstrainedInt):
    """Number of peerings."""

    ge = 1
    le = MAX_NUMBER_OF_PEERINGS
```

After:
```python
NumberOfPeerings = Annotated[
    int, Ge(1), Le(MAX_NUMBER_OF_PEERINGS), doc("Number of peerings.")
]
```


### orchestrator-core 2.0 changes

The following breaking changes have been made:
* Removed `SubscriptionInstanceList` -> see **SubscriptionInstanceList removed** (covered by migration-script)
* Removed `@serializable_property` -> use [`@computed_field`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.5/api/fields/#pydantic.fields.computed_field) instead (covered by migration-script)
* Removed `DomainModel.get_properties` -> use [`BaseModel.model_computed_fields()`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.5/api/base_model/#pydantic.main.BaseModel.model_computed_fields) instead
* Removed `build_extendend_domain_model()` -> use `build_extended_domain_model()` instead
* (pydantic-forms) Removed class `UniqueConstrainedList` -> see **UniqueConstrainedList**
* (pydantic-forms) Removed class `ChoiceList` -> use `choice_list()` instead
* (pydantic-forms) Removed class `ContactPersonList` -> use `contact_person_list()` instead
* (pydantic-forms) Moved `ReadOnlyField` import (covered by migration-script)
* (pydantic-forms) Changed `ReadOnlyField` from a Field to an Annotated Literal -> change your code from `field: int = ReadOnlyField(123)` to `field: ReadOnlyField(123)`



#### SubscriptionInstanceList removed

There are 2 different usecases of `SubscriptionInstanceList` that can be changed as follows.

Note: this change is covered by the migration script.

Note: you can no longer instantiate an annotated list type.

I.e. before you could write `mylist = ListMax2()` but this is no longer valid.
Instead, write `mylist: ListMax2 = []`.

**1. Generic List**

```python
class ListMax2(SubscriptionInstanceList[SI]):
    max_items = 2
```

becomes

```python
ListMax2 = Annotated[list[SI], Len(max_length=2)]
```

Which can then be used in a pydantic model, i.e. a product block, with a type subscription

```python
class MainProductBlockInactive(ProductBlockModel):
    values: ListMax2[SubProductBlockInactive]
```

When inheriting from this model you can change the type of the list, however a type: ignore comment is
needed to silence errors from type checkers like mypy.

```python
class MainProductBlockProvisioning(MyModel):
    values: ListMax2[SubProductBlockProvisioning]  # type: ignore
```

**2. Typed List**

```python
class ListMax2Numbers(SubscriptionInstanceList[int]):
    max_items = 2
```

Becomes:

```python
ListMax2Numbers = Annotated[list[int], Len(max_length=2)]
```

Which can then be used in a pydantic model without a type subscription

```python
class MyModel(BaseModel):
    values: ListMax2Numbers
```

#### UniqueConstrainedList

Class type has been removed. Replace with one of
* `unique_conlist(T)` can be imported from pydantic-forms
* `Annotated[list[T], AfterValidator(validate_unique_list)]`
* `Annotated[set, ...]`

Before:

```python
class ListOfTwo(UniqueConstrainedList[T]):
    min_items = 2
    max_items = 2
```

After:

```python
ListOfTwo = Annotated[list[T], AfterValidator(validate_unique_list), Len(2, 2)]
```

### Other recommended changes

**Set validators on the annotated type rather than on a FormPage/Model**

For example, instead of:

```python
AddedServicePorts = conlist(
    BgpServicePort, min_items=0, max_items=6 - len(current_service_ports)
)


class ModifySN8IPForm(FormPage):
    added_service_ports: AddedServicePorts

    _validate_single_vlan: classmethod = validator(
        "added_service_ports", allow_reuse=True
    )(validate_single_vlan)
    _validate_unique_vlans: classmethod = validator(
        "added_service_ports", allow_reuse=True
    )(validate_service_ports_unique_vlans)
```

Write:

```python
AddedServicePorts = Annotated[
    list[BgpServicePort],
    Len(0, 6 - len(current_service_ports)),
    AfterValidator(validate_single_vlan),
    AfterValidator(validate_service_ports_unique_vlans),
]


class ModifySN8IPForm(FormPage):
    added_service_ports: AddedServicePorts
```

This encapsulates validation logic to the type, making it easier to reuse in other places.

This also makes it possible to extend types, for example we could write the following to perform an extra validation on top of the existing ones.

```python
AddedServicePorts_Extra = Annotated[AddedServicePorts, AfterValidator(validate_extra)]
```

### What now?

After following all of these tips your IDE may still show plenty of errors in your orchestrator.

The best thing to do next is try to start your orchestrator and see which errors are critical to actually running it.

After that, you can start running your testsuite.
Pytest has (among many other things) the helpful option `--stepwise` that runs all your tests until the first failure.
Rerunning the command will resume running tests from the last failed test.
This will make it more manageable to start fixing the errors.

Once that is done, your pytest or orchestrator output may still contain many warnings to look into regarding deprecated changes.
