### Continuing the Workshop

The next sections introduce the workflow concept and its relationship to the product model.
Code examples referenced throughout can be found in the example orchestrator under the `.workflows.node` directory.

Please read at least the following pages to grasp the functionality of how workflows work and how the user/frontend will interact with the Orchestrator API:

* [Workflow Basics](workflow-basics.md)
* [Create Workflow](node-create.md)
