# API Documentation

The WFO has an API located at `/api/` and has browsable UI docs at `/api/redoc` OpenAPI spec available to download directly from your WFO instance. You can also view this here, however, we don't yet update this automatically in the docs upon release of a new version (TBD!), so pay attention to the version shown below.
