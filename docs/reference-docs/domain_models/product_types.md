# Product Types

A Product type (often referred to simply as a product) is the top level object of a domain model. A product is effectively the template used for creating a subscription instance, and you can instantiate as many of these as you want. You can use it like this:

::: orchestrator.domain.base.SubscriptionModel
    options:
        heading_level: 2
