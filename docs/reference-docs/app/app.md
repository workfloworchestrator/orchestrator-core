## Relevant Code

::: orchestrator.app
    options:
        heading_level: 3

## CLI App

The orchestrator core also has a CLI application that is documented in [detail here](../cli.md). You can bring this into your `main.py` file so that you can run the orchestrator CLI for development.

## Instantiating Your Application Instance

A great example of how to use the functions in app.py with your own `main.py` when you instantiate your own instance of the orchestrator can be seen in the [example orchestrator repository's](https://github.com/workfloworchestrator/example-orchestrator/blob/master/main.py) `main.py` file.

```python
{% include 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/workfloworchestrator/example-orchestrator/master/main.py' %}
```
