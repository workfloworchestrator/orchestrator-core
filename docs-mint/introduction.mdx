## Welcome to Workflow Orchestrator

The **Workflow Orchestrator** is a production-ready framework developed by [SURF](https://www.surf.nl) and [ESnet](https://www.es.net) to facilitate the orchestration of services. This open-source project helps you manage complex service lifecycles through intelligent automation and comprehensive audit logging.

## Why Orchestration?

When do you orchestrate and when do you automate? The answer is you probably need both. **Automation** helps you execute repetitive tasks reliably and easily. **Orchestration** adds a layer and allows you to add more intelligence to the tasks you need to automate and to have a complete audit log of changes.

<Note>
**Orchestrate** - *Transitive Verb* `/ˈôrkəˌstrāt/`

1. Arrange or score (music) for orchestral performance.
2. Arrange or direct the elements of (a situation) to produce a desired effect.

## What does a workflow look like?

Programming a new workflow is really easy. By defining workflows as Python functions, all you need to do is understand how to write basic Python code - the framework takes care of the rest.

```python
@workflow("Name of the workflow", initial_input_form=input_form_generator)
def workflow():
    return (
        init
        >> arbitrary_step_func_1
        >> arbitrary_step_func_2
        >> arbitrary_step_func_3
        >> done
    )
```

<Tip>
Workflows are composed of simple Python functions chained together with the `>>` operator, making them easy to read and maintain.
